## iGrow - Empowering African Farmers with AI
Welcome to the iGrow repository. This project aims to bridge the information gap faced by farmers in Africa by developing an AI-powered virtual agronomist platform. The platform leverages AI to provide personalized, data-driven insights and recommendations for sustainable and profitable agricultural practices.

## Structure
`backend/`: This directory contains the server-side code for the platform, including:
* API endpoints for communication with the app.
* Database models for storing user data, crop information, weather data and market data.
* AI model implementations for crop recommendation and crop disease and pest detection.

`app/`: This directory contains code for the application, including:
* User interface components
* Logic for user interactions and data input
* code for communicating with the backend API

`models/`: Here, you will find the trained AI models used by eShamba to enhance the platform's capabilities. The models are implemented using Python-based ML/AI libraries.

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to provide a collaborative space for the development and improvement of the iGrow platform.By making the repository publicly accessible, we aim to foster community engagement, allowing developers, researchers, agricultural experts, and users to explore the codebase, contribute to its development, report issues, and suggest enhancements. We believe that open collaboration will accelerate the platform's evolution into a robust and effective tool for empowering farmers in Kenya and beyond.

## How AI Powers iGrow platform
iGrow leverages the integration of multiple AI models and technologies to deliver personalized and actionable agricultural insights to farmers. Key features include:
* Intuitive model interface: A user-friendly interface designed specifically for farmers, providing access to information and tools.
* Real-time data integration: integration with various data sources to provide accurate and up-to-date information.
* Diverse applications: it has versatile use cases.
